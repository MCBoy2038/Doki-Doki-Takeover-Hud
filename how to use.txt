MODPACK:
Drag the file, "DDTO Hud" to your mods folder.
Open your application and go to the mods section.
Find DDTO+ Hud.
Once you find it, enable it.
Struggling, watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ6rY_51mqo

Mods Folder:
Just basically copy everything into your mods folder that you see. Pretty self explanitory, right?
Don't drag pack while your at it.
